        <div id="text-content">
            
        
        <p>Hi, it's The Insider Sandrush.</p>

        <p>On Sunday, 21st December 2025, I attended this year's Comic Fiesta again accompanied by my sister, who were probably hanging around Suria KLCC.</p>

        <p>Since this is my second time going to a convention surrounded by lots of cosplayers and artists, here's how it goes:</p>
        
        <div id="divider"></div>
        <h1>Heading towards KLCC</h1>
        <p>For this time, I need to eat some food, so I had to go with my family to a <i><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kenduri">kenduri</a></i>. I only eat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasi_minyak">Nasi minyak</a>, with fried chicken, and to finish it up... some junk food!!.</p>
        
        <div id="divider"></div>

        <h1>I arrived, at KLCC.</h1>
        <p>After few moments later, I moved and actually already arrived at KLCC's entrance. Here's how it looks.</p>

        <a href="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_160925.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Comic Fiesta 2025 entrance indicator." title="Comic Fiesta 2025 entrance indicator." src="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_160925.jpg" width="25%"></a>
        
        <p>When I walk up, for a little bit, I eventually able to find my way out to the walking areas. Then, I saw someone talking about a recent <a href="https://nitter.net/peta/status/1998799806429356494" title="From @peta on Twitter (contains content prohibited under Cygames' guidelines on fan content for Umamusume): &quot;If Umamusume: Pretty Derby were honest, your favorite horse girl doesn’t get a comeback arc. One failed event, and the race is over forever—just like what happened to the real Silence Suzuka.&quot;">Tweet</a> made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals">PETA</a> that looks like <a href="https://nitter.net/pic/media/G70pljOWEAEwPxU.jpg">this (CONTENT WARNING)</a>. I ignored that, then I just walk in, heading towards the entrance way.</p>

        <p>Weirdly this year, there isn't any rainings happening, despite it's the season.</p>

        <p>Since the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mtbtohobrigade.bsky.social/post/3m57dhk5yy22b">Malaysian Touhou Brigade just moved their gathering day to Saturday</a>, I quickly forgot my plan to look at Symphony Lake, and I just straight to lining up, entering the convention center.</p>

        <p>Here's the pic: </p>
        <a href="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_161556.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Comic Fiesta 2025 Sunday entry indicator." title="Comic Fiesta 2025 Sunday entry indicator." src="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_161556.jpg" width="25%"></a>
        <br>
        <p><i>Lining up is not that tired btw...</i></p>
        <div id="divider"></div>
        
        <h1>I'm already in...</h1>
        <p>After unusual and a little bit short lines and relatively almost empty scanning ticket/pass, I finally entered, once again.</p>
        <a href="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_162232.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="A banner in the ceiling greeting attenders: S'up!" title="A banner in the ceiling greeting attenders: S'up!" src="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_162232.jpg" width="35%"></a>

        <p>For sometimes, I actually going to look at some booths to see what they've got to offer. There's one from Acer with sponsor from Intel bruh, at the same place. Here's a video clip about that.</p>
        <video src="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/video_20251221_162305.mp4" controls loop width="50%"></video>

        <p>Then, I buy some book at <a title="From the publisher's website: Home - Gempak Starz | Malaysia Top Publisher | Top Malaysia Comic" href="https://gempakstarz.com">Gempak Starz</a> booth (I picked The second compilation for <a title="From Fandom: The Golden Age Of Adventure Wiki" href="https://the-golden-age-of-adventure.fandom.com/wiki/The_Golden_Age_Of_Adventure_Wiki">The Golden Age of Adventures</a>). Just like last year, <a href="https://gempakstarz.com/kaoru/">Kaoru</a> was there as well. However, I've decided to not taking a picture with her because I've never took a picture with an illustrator.</p>
        
        <p>And then, before I exited the building, I decided to check out Art Market because I've never made it to there due to lacking knowledge about directories.</p>

        <div id="divider"></div>

        <h1>Entering the Art Market</h1>
          <p>For the first time ever, I've finally entered the Art Market, where there's actually fanarts, doujins, and more, sold there.</p>
          <img src="/media-repository/comicfiesta/2025/IMG_20251221_175938.jpg" width="100%">
          <p>So, here's things that I buy there.</p>
          <img src="/blog/images/2025/12/22/IMG_20251222_234342.jpg" width="100%">

                        <br>
                    </ul>
          <div id="divider"></div>
        <p>At 6:00pm, I decided to finally getting out of the Art Market after lots of shopping spree for the first time ever. At that time, I need to go find my sister because she was there too, and she found me. But because I found a lot of cosplayers going around (lots of them primarily are from the Genshin Impact community) across the Christmas tree and inside the Suria KLCC, so I ask for my sister to wait for me.</p>

        <p>So, I took some pictures with them.</p>

        <b>Due to privacy reasons, I can't show these images.</b>

        <p>Note: I actually took a picture together with another <a title="From Wikipedia (English): Furina de Fontaine is a character from Genshin Impact, a 2020 action role-playing gacha game developed by miHoYo." href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furina_(Genshin_Impact)">Furina</a> cosplayer.</p>

        <p>Eventually, I settled together with my sister and go back to my home via means of public transport with stuff that I bringing back home.</p>

        <div id="divider"></div>
        <h1>Boring hits harder than brick, but it's still fun.</h1>
          <p>Immediately when I arrived at home, I felt like normally happy. I didn't felt depressed like last year, and I'm just ready to spend another three weeks of normal stuff.</p>
        
          <div id="divider"></div>
        <h1>End of the word</h1>
          <p>Thanks for reading this article about my experience attending Comic Fiesta 2025, second year of visiting Comic Fiesta. See you in Comic Fiesta 2026 (if there are any, or if I can make it to there). And also, Merry Christmas to everyone who are celebrating it. Also, bye!</p>
