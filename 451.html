          <p><b>Gooner TLDR</b>: Parts of The Insider Sandrush website (NSFW Section) is not available to be viewed in the UK to comply with regulations. The current Labour admin is dumb, we're looking into solutions. Come to our Fardcord and cry about it. There is a petition here if you want to vote against it. Text you don't want to read:</p>
          
          <p>We regret to inform you that the Ofcom require us to verify your age before granting access to NSFW section of our website. While we are deeply committed to safety and compliance, mandating ID verification for every visit to a platform hosting fictional, animated content is not only impractical but also fundamentally misguided. The financial cost of implementing age verification per user is prohibitively high, rendering it impossible for us to sustain operations under these mandates.

          <p>Requiring age verification for fictional cartoon content is an overreach that fails to recognise the distinction between real-world adult material and artistic, animated works. These laws unfairly burden platforms like ours, which focus on creative, non-realistic content that poses no direct harm. They divert resources from enhancing user safety to complying with impractical regulations, driving traffic to less regulated sites with weaker safety measures.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, these mandates jeopardise user privacy by requiring sensitive personal information, which could deter users from accessing legal, creative content while doing little to address actual risks. The safety of our community remains our top priority, and we believe a more effective solution is device-based identification that respects user privacy while allowing access to age-restricted content. We sincerely hope these overly broad laws are overturned soon, restoring access to our platform for all fans of animated art.</p>

          <p>Until a sensible, privacy-respecting solution is implemented, we have made the difficult decision to disable access to our website in regions with these requirements. Please contact your local representatives to advocate for device-based verification solutions and the repeal of these impractical laws, ensuring a safer internet while preserving access to creative content.</p>
